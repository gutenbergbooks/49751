<p>Many of these stories and rhymes appeared
originally in the <i>Ladies’ Home Journal</i>, and were
signed either with my initials, or with names of
characters in my books. Others were adapted by
me from the Indian “Hitopadesa,” or “Book of
Good Counsel,” and from two anonymous story-books
of a bygone generation, long out of print.
These are marked “Adapted.”</p>

<h2>JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX</h2>


<p>Johnny’s sand box is in the back yard. It
is a fine big box, with the sides raised so that
Johnny and the sand will not fall out. The sand
is fine and dry, and almost white; it came from
the seashore, and sometimes you find a little shell
in it.</p>

<p>The things that belong in the sand box (beside
Johnny himself!) are the blue tin pail to hold sand,
and the red tin pail to hold water, and the shovel,
and the rake, and the old kitchen spoon. The
things that do <i>not</i> belong there (some of them)
are the woolly dog (because the sand gets all into
his wool, and then shakes out on the nursery floor,
and Maggie says it is a Sight!), and Johnny’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
shoes and stockings (he likes to take them off and
sift the hot, clean sand between his bare toes),
and the neighbors’ cats.</p>

<p>This story is about the cats. There are five of
them. One is black, and has a red leather collar
with a little silver bell; it belongs to the deaf old
lady next door, and its name is Jetty. Another
is yellow, and belongs to the lame girl in the white
house with green blinds; its name is Topaz. The
third cat is gray, with white front and paws. This
is a lady cat, and her name is Malta; she belongs
to the lady whom Johnny calls Mrs. Nose.
Mamma does not allow him to say this, and he
tries to remember, but sometimes he forgets; one
day he said right out, “Good morning, Mrs.
Nose!” and she only laughed, and said her nose
was just the right size, and she needed it all to
smell catnip with. She is a funny lady, and
Johnny likes her, and Malta too.</p>

<p>The fourth cat belongs to Mr. Chops the butcher,
and is a big tabby, with green eyes and fierce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
whiskers. Johnny does not like him at all. But
the fifth cat is Muffet, his own dear white kitten.</p>

<p>Now all these cats were friends except Bobs,
the butcher’s cat. He lives on meat, and Mamma
says perhaps that makes him cross. Anyhow, he
is cross, and he growls and snarls and spits at Muffet
and Jetty and Topaz and Malta, and tries to
steal their fishbones, and upsets their milk, and
is really a very horrid cat.</p>

</div>

<p>The story happened one night last week.
Johnny was asleep, and Maggie was tidying up
the nursery before going to bed, when suddenly
she heard a queer noise. It came from the yard,
and she stepped to the window and looked out.
It was bright moonlight; and what do you think?
The cats were having a party in the sand box!
the four friendly cats, that is, Muffet and Topaz
and Malta and Jetty. Maggie thought Muffet
must have invited the others, for she was sitting
in the middle of the box with her front paws
tucked under her, looking so pleased and happy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and the three others had their paws tucked in
too, and they were all four talking in little soft
mews, and seemed to be having a very good time.
Then all of a sudden there was a snarl and a yowl,
and that horrid great Bobs
sprang over the fence and into the sand
box, and began clawing and spitting and
scratching right and left, just as hard as he could.
At first the four friendly cats were too startled to
do anything; but in another minute <i>they</i> began
to spit and scratch and claw, and there were all
five of them rolling over and over, scattering the
sand on every side, and making such a noise that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
it woke Johnny out of his sound sleep. At first he
was frightened, but Maggie told him what it was,
and said wait and see what she would do. She
pushed up the fly screen very softly, and then she
brought the great big jug full of water, and leaning
out,—splash! she emptied it full on the fighting,
struggling cats. <i>Oh!</i> how they yelled! One
jumped this way, and one jumped that; and the
next moment not one was left except poor little
Muffet, sitting in the middle of the box and crying
pitifully. “Oh, <i>poor</i> Muffy!” said Johnny.
“Poor Muffy <i>all</i> wet!” So then good Maggie
ran down and brought Muffet up, and dried her
with a towel, and comforted her till she purred.
Johnny wanted to take her into bed with him,
but Maggie said that never would do; so,—what
<i>do</i> you think? She put her in the doll’s cradle
with Susan Dolly, and covered her up, and told
her to go to sleep, and she did!</p>

<h2>THE NEW LEAVES</h2>


<p>“Wake up!” said a clear little voice. Tommy
woke, and sat up in bed. At the foot of the bed
stood a boy about his own age, all dressed in white,
like fresh snow. He had very bright eyes, and he
looked straight at Tommy.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“I am the New Year!” said the boy. “This
is my day, and I have brought you your leaves.”</p>

<p>“What leaves?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“The new ones, to be sure!” said the New
Year. “I hear bad accounts of you from my
Daddy—”</p>

<p>“Who is your Daddy?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“The Old Year, of course!” said the boy. “He
said you asked too many questions and I see he
was right. He says you are greedy, too, and that
you sometimes pinch your little sister, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
one day you threw your reader into the fire. Now,
all this must stop.”</p>

<p>“Oh, must it?” said Tommy. He felt frightened,
and did not know just what to say.</p>

<p>The boy nodded. “If it does not stop,” he said,
“you will grow worse and worse every year, till
you grow up into a Horrid Man. Do you want to
be a Horrid Man?”</p>

<p>“N-no!” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Then you must stop being a horrid boy!”
said the New Year. “Take your leaves!” and
he held out a packet of what looked like copy-book
leaves, all sparkling white, like his own
clothes.</p>

<p>“Turn over one of these every day,” he said,
“and soon you will be a good boy instead of a
horrid one.”</p>

<p>Tommy took the leaves and looked at them. On
each leaf a few words were written. On one it
said, “Help your mother!” On another, “Don’t
pull the cat’s tail!” On another, “Don’t eat so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
much!” And on still another, “Don’t fight Billy
Jenkins!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Tommy. “I <i>have</i> to fight Billy
Jenkins! He said—”</p>

<p>“Good-by!” said the New Year. “I shall
come again when I am old to see whether you have
been a good boy or a horrid one. Remember,</p>

<p>He turned away and opened the window. A
cold wind blew in and
swept the leaves out of Tommy’s
hand. “Stop! stop!” he cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
“Tell me—” But the New Year was gone, and
Tommy, staring after him, saw only his mother
coming into the room. “Dear child!” she said.
“Why, the wind is blowing everything about.”</p>

<p>“My leaves! My leaves!” cried Tommy; and
jumping out of bed he looked all over the room,
but he could not find one.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Tommy. “I can turn
them just the same, and I mean to. I will not
grow into a Horrid Man.” And he didn’t.</p>

<h2>THE NEW LEAF</h2>


<p>“Why are you crying, Little Cat?” asked Little
Dog.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;">
<img src="images/ill21.jpg" width="406" height="187" alt="cat crying, dog listening to tale" />
</div>

<p>“Because my paws are so cold!” said Little
Cat. “I have been digging in the snow and I cannot
find one.”</p>

<p>“One what?” asked Little Dog.</p>

<p>“One new leaf.”</p>

<p>“What do you want of a new leaf?”</p>

<p>“I want to turn it over, but there just aren’t
any to turn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course there aren’t!” said Little Dog. “It
is winter.”</p>

<p>“But Little Girl is going to find one,” said Little
Cat. “I heard her mother say to her, ‘You
really must turn over a new leaf!’ and she said,
‘I truthfully will, Mamma!’ and when Little Girl
says she truthfully will she always does. Then
her mother kissed her, and said everybody had to
turn over new leaves now, and she had some of
her own to turn, so she knew just how it was. The
door shut then—on the tip of my tail, too—and I
heard no more; but what do you suppose it
means?”</p>

<p>Little Dog shook his head. “We must ask
somebody,” he said. “Let me see! Great Old
Dog is out for a walk, and Crosspatch Parrot bit
me the last time I asked her a question.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Little Cat. “We will ask Old
Cat in the Barn. She knows a good many things,
and if she isn’t catching rats—but she generally
is—she will tell us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;">
<img src="images/ill22.jpg" width="405" height="619" alt="cat on top of haystack, dog and once crying cat below" />
<div class="caption">“THEY FOUND OLD CAT IN THE BARN SITTING ON A TRUSS OF
HAY, WASHING HERSELF.”</div>
</div>

<p>They found Old Cat in the Barn sitting on
a truss of hay, washing herself. She listened
to Little Cat’s story, and her green eyes
twinkled.</p>

<p>“So you have been looking for new leaves
under the snow!” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Little Cat. “First I looked on the
trees, and there weren’t any there; so I thought
it must be leaves of plants and things, so I
scratched and dug till my poor paws were almost
quite frozen, but not one single scrap of a leaf
could I find.”</p>

<p>“Fffff!” said Old Cat in the Barn. “This
barn is full of ’em!”</p>

<p>“Full of leaves!” cried Little Cat and Little
Dog together. “What can you mean, Old Cat?
We don’t call hay leaves!”</p>

<p>“How many rats have you caught this week?”
asked Old Cat, turning to Little Dog.</p>

<p>“None!” said Little Dog. “The last rat I
caught bit me horridly; besides, they are odious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
vulgar beasts, and I don’t care to have anything
to do with them.”</p>

<p>“Fffff!” said Old Cat. “Little Cat, how many
mice have you caught in the kitchen this week?”</p>

<p>Little Cat hung her head. “I haven’t caught
any,” she said. “I don’t care for mice, the flavor
is too strong; I like cream better.”</p>

<p>“Ffffff! grrrr-yow!” said Old Cat; her green
eyes shot out sparks, and her fur began to stand
up. “Now, you two, listen to me! Why do you
think the Big People keep you? Because you are
soft and pretty and foolish? Not at all! They
keep you because you are supposed to be useful.
Your mother, Little Cat, was a hard-working, self-respecting
mouser, who caught her daily mouse as
regularly as she ate her daily bread and milk.
Your father, Little Dog, hunted rats with me in
this barn as long as he had legs to stand upon, and
between us we kept the place in tolerable order.
Great Old Dog cannot be expected to hunt at his
age, and besides, he is too big; one might as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hunt with an ox. But since your parents died you
two lazy children have done next to nothing, and
what is the consequence? I am worked to skin
and bone, and the mice are all over the house; I
heard Cook say so. Mind what I say; no creature,
with four legs or two, is worth his salt unless he
earns it, in one way or another. Now, what have
you to say for yourselves?”</p>

<p>“Miaouw!” said Little Cat. “I am very sorry,
Old Cat.”</p>

<p>“Yap! Yap!” said Little Dog. “I am sorry
too, Old Cat.”</p>

<p>“Very well!” said Old Cat in the Barn. “Then
turn over a new leaf!”</p>

<p>“Miaouw!” “Yap!” “That is just what we
want to do!” said Little Cat and Little Dog together;
“but we can’t find any.”</p>

<p>“The fact is,” said Old Cat in the Barn, “it is
one of the foolish ways of speaking that the Big
People have. It just means, stop being bad and
begin to be good. Now do you see?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“Prrr!” said Little Cat; “now I see. I will
go and catch a mouse this minute, Old Cat.”</p>

<p>“Wuff!” said Little Dog; “I see, too, and I
will come and hunt rats with you, Old Cat.”</p>

<p>“Prrrrrrr!” said Old Cat in the Barn. “That
is right! Go to work, like good children, and as
I may have been rather short with you lately I will
turn over a new leaf, too, and ask you both to
supper with me in my hay-parlor. Cook gave me
the bones of the Christmas goose, and we will have
a great feast.”</p>

<h2>NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD</h2>


<p>“Do I look nice?” asked the Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Very nice!” said the Chipmunk; “that is,
for a person who has no tail to speak of. But, of
course, you cannot help that.”</p>

<p>The Rabbit looked into the looking-glass pond
and saw his little white blob of a tail. “Don’t you
want to lend me yours, just this once?” he asked.
“I would take great care of it!”</p>

<p>“No, I cannot do that,” said the Chipmunk,
“but I can lend you the tail of my late uncle. It
is such a fine one that we have kept it to brush out
the nest with.”</p>

<p>“The very thing!” said the Rabbit.</p>

<p>So the Chipmunk brought the tail of his late
uncle and tied it on to the Rabbit’s stub.</p>

<p>“How does that look?” asked the Rabbit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fine!” said the Chipmunk. “Now tell me
how I look!”</p>

<p>“Well enough!” said the Rabbit. “Of course,
you would look better if you had long ears.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said the Chipmunk; and he, too,
looked into the looking-glass pond. “Haven’t
you a spare pair that you could lend me?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said the Rabbit. “There is a pair
that belonged to my grandfather, hanging on the
wall at home. I will get those.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">
<img src="images/ill24.jpg" width="413" height="186" alt="A bunny dressing a chipmunk (really a squirrel) as a bunny" />
</div>

<p>So the Rabbit got the ears and tied them on to
the Chipmunk’s head.</p>

<p>“How do I look now?” asked the Chipmunk.</p>

<p>“Splendid!” said the Rabbit. “Now let us go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and make our New Year’s calls. Where shall we
go first?”</p>

<p>“I wish to call on Miss Woodchuck!” said the
Chipmunk.</p>

<p>“So do I,” said the Rabbit. “We will go there
first.” And off they went.</p>

<p>They came to Miss Woodchuck’s door and
knocked, and she opened the door. “Mercy!”
she cried. “Who are you, and what do you
want?”</p>

<p>“We are Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Chipmunk,” said
the two friends, “and we have come to make you
a New Year’s call.”</p>

<p>“More likely you have come to steal the nuts!”
said the lady angrily. “I know Mr. Rabbit and
Mr. Chipmunk well, and neither of you is either
of them. Who ever heard of a long-tailed rabbit
or a long-eared squirrel? Get along with you!
You are frights, and probably thieves as well.”
And she shut the door in their faces.</p>

<p>The two friends walked a little way in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
silence; then they stopped and looked at each
other.</p>

<p>“You said I looked fine!” said the Rabbit.</p>

<p>“I—I meant the tail!” said the Chipmunk.
“It is a fine tail. But you said I looked splendid!”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of the ears!” said the Rabbit.
“They are splendid ears.”</p>

<p>They walked on until they came once more to
the looking-glass pond. They looked at themselves;
then they looked at each other; then, all
in a minute, off came the long ears and tail.</p>

<p>“There!” cried the Chipmunk. “Now we look
as we were meant to look; and I am bound to say,
Rabbit, that it is much more becoming to you.”</p>

<p>“So it is to you!” replied the Rabbit. “Now
shall we call on Miss Woodchuck again?”</p>

<p>“Come on!” said the Chipmunk.</p>

<p>So they went to Miss Woodchuck’s house, and
knocked once more at the door, and Miss Woodchuck
opened it. “Oh!” she cried. “Mr. Chipmunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and Mr. Rabbit, how do you do? I am so
glad to see you. A happy New Year to you both!”</p>

<p>“The same to you, Ma’am!” said the Rabbit
and the Chipmunk.</p>

<h2>THE BOASTFUL DONKEY<br />

<small>(Adapted)</small></h2>


<p>Once upon a time there was a donkey who lived
in a field where there was no pond; so he had
never seen his own image, and he thought he was
the biggest and strongest and handsomest creature
in the world.</p>

<p>One day a lion came through the field, and, being
a polite beast, stopped to greet the donkey.
“Good morning, friend!” he said. “What a fine
day this is!”</p>

<p>“Fine enough, I dare say!” said the donkey.
“I never think about the weather. I have other
things to think about.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said the lion. “May I ask what
things?”</p>

<p>“None of your business!” said the donkey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
rudely; and he set up a loud braying, thinking to
frighten the lion away.</p>

<p>“Why do you bray?” asked the lion.</p>

<p>“Bray!” cried the donkey. “That was not
braying—it was roaring!”</p>

<p>“If you think I don’t know braying from roaring,”
said the lion, still politely, “you are mistaken.
That was a bray.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 403px;">
<img src="images/ill26.jpg" width="403" height="197" alt="donkey kicking and braying in front of lion" />
</div>

<p>“Very well!” shouted the
donkey. “If that was, this shall not be!” and he
uttered a long and loud “Hee-haw!” and kicked
up his heels in angry pride. “What do you call
that?” he asked proudly.</p>

<p>“I call it a bray,” replied the lion; “and a very
ugly one. You see, after all, you are a donkey;
look at the length of your ears!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“How dare you?” cried the donkey. “My
ears are the finest in the world, everybody says
so. And as for roaring, if I have not scared you
yet, just listen to me now!” And flinging up his
heels again he bellowed till his own long ears tingled
with the sound.</p>

<p>He expected the lion to be terrified, but the lion
merely smiled.</p>

<p>“You certainly can make a most hideous
noise,” he said; “but when all is said and done,
it is only a bray. If you really wish to know
how a roar sounds I shall be happy to oblige
you.”</p>

<p>The King of Beasts then began to lash his
tail and pretended to fall into a great passion.
His eyes flashed fire, his tawny mane bristled;
he opened his great mouth, and a roar like
thunder filled the air. The donkey, after one terrified
look, took to his heels and scampered off as
fast as he could go, tumbled into a ditch, and lay
there all day, not daring to move for fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The lion went on his way smiling. “It
is a pity,” he said, “for a person to live
in a place where he cannot see what he looks
like.”</p>

<h2>THE CAT’S NAME</h2>


<p>Tom had a cat who was so white that he named
her Snow. He loved Snow and thought her the
best cat in the world, but she would not come when
she was called.</p>

<p>One day Snow went and played in the coal-bin,
and when she came out she was quite black.</p>

<p>“See, Mother,” said Tom: “Snow cannot be
Snow now, for she is black. What shall I name
her?”</p>

<p>“You might name her Soot!” said his mother.</p>

<p>So he named Snow Soot. Snow did not care,
and Soot did not care, but neither of them came
when she was called.</p>

<p>One day Snow saw a tin pot on the shed floor,
and Soot thought there might be cream in it; and
Snow went to see, and Soot fell in, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
green paint, and when she came out she was all
green.</p>

<p>“See, Mother,” said Tom. “My cat is not
white now, so she cannot be Snow, and she is not
black, so she cannot be Soot. What shall I name
her now?”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/ill27.jpg" width="368" height="253" alt="cat getting into the paint" />
</div>

<p>“You might name her Grass,” said his mother,
“till you have washed
her; but I would wash
her soon if I
were you.”</p>

<p>So, Tom
named the cat Grass. Snow did not care, and
Soot did not care, and Grass did not care, but none
of them came when they were called.</p>

<p>“How can I wash her,” asked Tom, “if she will
not come when she is called?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let me try!” said his mother. So she called,
“Puss! Puss! Puss!” and the cat came running
as fast as she could.</p>

<p>“Why-ee!” said Tom. “I think her name
must be Puss.”</p>

<p>“I think so, too,” said his mother.</p>

<h2>JOHNNY’S RED SHOES AND WHITE
STOCKINGS</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 316px;">
<img src="images/ill29.jpg" width="316" height="448" alt="boy in sailor suit" />
</div>

<p>For every day, Johnny always wears blue; blue
rompers in the morning, when he is playing in the
sand box or helping Maggie make bread in the
kitchen, and a blue sailor suit in the afternoon,
when he goes “walk-a-walk-a” with Mamma.
But on Sunday afternoon he goes walk-a-walk-a
with Daddy (but they take Mamma too!), and <i>then</i>
he has on his white sailor suit, and his white stockings
and red shoes. Aunt Kitty brought him the
shoes, and when they came there was a china cat
inside one, and a tin frog inside the other. They
were surprises, the cat and the frog; Aunt Kitty
likes to give surprises.</p>

<p>Well! one Sunday morning Mamma and Daddy
were going to church, and Maggie was very busy,
so she put Johnny in the sand box, and told him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to play like a good boy, and he did. He made two
forts, one with the red tin pail and one with the
blue tin pail; and then he hammered
on them with the old
kitchen spoon and said, “Bang!
bang! bang!” and that made a
battle. While he was having the
battle, the Boy Over the
Fence came and looked
through the pickets,
and
said,
“Hurnh! I’ve
got new shoes on!” Johnny
looked, and he had; new brown
shoes, that tied in front. So
Johnny said: “I have
new shoes too, only they are not on; they are up-stairs,
and they are red.”</p>

<p>“They ain’t!” said the Boy Over the Fence.
He was not a very nice boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">
<img src="images/ill30.jpg" width="413" height="620" alt="boy in sailors suit holding up shoes to boy looking through fence" />
<div class="caption">“HE HELD THEM UP SO THAT THE BOY OVER THE FENCE COULD
SEE THEM.”</div>
</div>

<p>“They are!” said Johnny. “Bright red, with
wankle buttons. Aunt Kitty bringed them, and
there was a cat in one, and a frog in the other,
and they were s’prises. And white stockings too,
so there!” Then he stopped, for he was out of
breath.</p>

<p>“Hurnh!” said the Boy Over the Fence.
“Let’s see ’em!”</p>

<p>Johnny trotted up the back stairs and brought
down the white stockings and the red shoes; they
were laid out on the chair, with the white suit, all
ready for him to put on. He held them up so that
the Boy Over the Fence could see them, and said,
“So there!” again; it was all he could think of
to say.</p>

<p>And the Boy Over the Fence said, “Hurnh!”
again, as if that was all <i>he</i> could think of to say.</p>

<p>Just then Maggie opened the kitchen door and
said: “Come in this minute of time, Johnny boy,
and get your luncheon! see the nice cracker and
the lovely mug of milk Maggie has for ye!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Johnny was hungry, and he dropped the red
shoes and white stockings and ran in to have his
luncheon. While he was eating it, Maggie told
him the story of the Little Rid Hin; (Mamma says
it is “Red Hen,” really, but Maggie always says
it the other way, and Johnny likes it better); and
then she said it was time for his nap, and she
whisked him up-stairs and tucked him up in his
crib and told him to go to sleep like a good boy,
and he went.</p>

<p>By and by he woke up, and Mamma came in to
dress him for dinner. She washed his face and
hands, and brushed his hair, and put on his white
sailor suit; and then she said, “Why, where ever
are the shoes and stockings?”</p>

<p>She looked under the chair, and on the bureau,
and under the bed. “Johnny,” she said, “I cannot
find your red shoes and white stockings. I
put them here with your suit, and now they are
gone.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Johnny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you know where they are, dear?” asked
Mamma.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Johnny again. “I think—they
are in—the sand box!”</p>

<p>“<i>In the sand box!</i>” said Mamma.</p>

<p>“The Boy Over the Fence said they wasn’t
red,” said Johnny; “and they was, and I
gotted them and showed him, and then Maggie
called me, and—and—I think that is all I
know.”</p>

<p>“My goodness!” said Mamma. And she ran
down-stairs and out into the yard to the sand box.
But no red shoes or white stockings were there.
Mamma looked all about carefully. There was the
red tin pail, and the blue tin pail, both turned
upside down, and the old kitchen spoon laid across
them. And there were the marks of Johnny’s
moccasins, and—oh! there were the marks of another
pair of shoes, a little bigger than Johnny’s,
with heels to them.</p>

<p>“My goodness!” said Mamma. “You don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
suppose—” but she did not say what you didn’t
suppose.</p>

<p>She looked over toward the next yard. There
was no one there, but there were muddy footmarks
leading from the fence to the sand box, and sandy
footmarks leading back from the sand box to the
fence.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Mamma, “I am afraid—” but she
did not say what she was afraid of.</p>

<p>Just as she was stepping out of the sand box,
her foot struck against the red tin pail and
knocked it over; and—what <i>do</i> you think? Inside
of the pail was one red shoe and one white
stocking.</p>

<p>“My goodness!” said Mamma again. Then
she turned over the blue tin pail, and there was
the other red shoe and the other white stocking.</p>

<p>Mamma looked very severely over the fence, but
no one was there; so she took the shoes and stockings
up-stairs and showed them to Johnny.
“Oh!” said Johnny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>She told him where she had found them; and
then she put them away in the drawer, and
brought out Johnny’s old brown moccasins and a
pair of rather old brown stockings. “You shall
wear these to-day!” said Mamma.</p>

<p>“But why?” said Johnny. “I like my red
shoes and white stockings best.”</p>

<p>“But you took them out and left them in the
sand box!” said Mamma.</p>

<p>“But I did forget!” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“But this will help you to remember!” said
Mamma.</p>

<p>And it did.</p>

<h2>THE FOOLISH TORTOISE<br />

<small>(Adapted)</small></h2>


<p>Close beside the Pool of the Blue Lotus lived
the two geese White-Wings and Gray-Back, and
in the pool lived the tortoise Shelly-Neck, and
the three were good friends. One night Shelly-Neck
heard two fishermen talking together beside
the pool. “To-morrow morning,” they said, “we
will lay our nets and catch that old tortoise and
cook him for our dinner.”</p>

<p>Shelly-Neck was much frightened, and when the
men were gone he called his friends the geese, and
begged them to save him.</p>

<p>“We will save you,” said White-Wings.</p>

<p>“But you must do just what we tell you to do!”
said Gray-Back.</p>

<p>“I will! I will!” cried poor Shelly-Neck.</p>

<p>The two geese waddled about, looking till they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
found a stick. “Now,” said White-Wings, “take
this in your mouth and hold on tight!”</p>

<p>“And remember,” said Gray-Back, “that once
you have taken hold you must not let go till we
bid you.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;">
<img src="images/ill31.jpg" width="384" height="180" alt="Ducks at side of pond with turtle" />
</div>

<p>The tortoise promised and took hold on the middle
of the stick with his strong jaws. Then White-Wings
took one end of the stick in his bill and
Gray-Back took the other, and they flew high up
in the air over the roofs of the houses.</p>

<p>All the people came running to see this strange
sight. “Look! look!” cried one. “See the flying
tortoise!”</p>

<p>“Ho!” said another, who was one of the fishermen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
“He has no wings; soon he will forget and
open his mouth, and then down he will come and
we shall have him for dinner.”</p>

<p>“I will not let go! You shall not have me for
dinner!” cried Shelly-Neck.</p>

<p>Crash! Down he fell on the hard ground. When
the fishermen picked him up he was dead and they
did have him for dinner.</p>

<p>White-Wings and Gray-Back flew sadly away.
“We did our best,” they said; “but a fool cannot
be saved from his folly.”</p>

<h2>LITTLE CAT’S VALENTINE</h2>


<p>Great Old Dog was taking a nap before the parlor
fire. He lay stretched out on the white bear
skin, and reached almost from end to end, for he
was a very great old dog indeed. By-and-by he
woke up, and saw Little Dog sitting in front of
him looking very melancholy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px;">
<img src="images/ill33.jpg" width="382" height="173" alt="Dog and little dog" />
</div>

<p>“What’s the matter, young one?” asked Great
Old Dog. “Where’s Little Cat?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know!” said Little Dog dolefully.
“We don’t speak to each other any more.”</p>

<p>“Wuff!” said Great Old Dog. “Since when?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Since half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Wuff!” said Great Old Dog. “Why?”</p>

<p>“She was horrid to me,” said Little Dog,
“about a bone; and—and then I was horrid to
her.”</p>

<p>“And you think two wrongs make a right?”
said Great Old Dog. “They don’t. That is
monkey arithmetic, not fit for respectable dogs
and cats. My advice to you is to make it up as
soon as you can.”</p>

<p>“But she says she will never speak to me
again!” said Little Dog piteously.</p>

<p>Great Old Dog yawned so wide that Little Dog
could have got inside his mouth and turned
around.</p>

<p>“She will!” he said.</p>

<p>“How do you know, Great Old Dog?”</p>

<p>“Wuff! I know cats.”</p>

<p>“I think she has gone out to see Old Cat in the
Barn,” Little Dog continued. “Perhaps she may
live out there and never come back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“She’ll come back,” said Great Old Dog. “She
will miss you just as much as you miss her. Make
it up, I tell you! Quarrelling is the silliest thing
there is,” and he went to sleep again.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” said Little Dog. “I do miss Little
Cat dreadfully, and the door is shut. Oh, oh
dear!”</p>

<p>Little Girl was sitting at the desk, doing things
with gold and silver paper. Little Dog went up
to her and asked very prettily to be let out; but
Little Girl was not so clever as usual.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Little Dog?” she asked.
“Do you want a valentine?”</p>

<p>“Please let me out!” said Little Dog; but she
thought he said “Yap!”</p>

<p>“Listen, Little Dog!” she said. “Will this
do?” She took up a frilled sheet with gold
hearts on it and read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘If your heart is true as mine,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Come and be my valentine.’”</span></div>

<div class="caption">“THEN SHE MADE TWO LITTLE STARS AND PASTED THEM ON THE
TIPS OF HIS EARS.”</div>
</div>

<p>“<i>Please</i> let me out!” said Little Dog; but she
thought he said “Yap!”</p>

<p>“This is Valentine’s Day, Little Dog,” Little
Girl went on. “You ought to send a valentine to
Little Cat.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘If your heart is true as mine,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Come and be my valentine.’</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Why, Little Dog, you shall be her valentine. Come
here, sir!”</p>

<p>Little Girl took a sheet of lace paper, crimped
it into a frill, and tucked it into Little Dog’s collar.
It tickled him woefully, but he said not a
word, for he loved Little Girl almost next to Little
Cat.</p>

<p>“You are lovely, Little Dog!” said Little Girl.
“You are the best valentine I have made yet.
Wait now!” She made a big star of gold paper
and pinned it to his collar; then she made two
little stars and pasted them on the tips of his ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are a <i>lovely</i> valentine!” she cried, clapping
her hands. “And there is Little Cat mewing
to be let in this minute. Now when I open
the door, Little Dog, go straight up to her and
say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘If your heart is true as mine,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Let me be your valentine!’”</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She opened the door and Little Cat started to
come in, but when she saw Little Dog she stopped
and looked shy.</p>

<p>Little Dog went up to her and said:</p>

<p>“If your heart is true as mine, Little Cat, I am
sorry I was horrid about the bone; let me be your
valentine and I want to make up.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Little Dog,” said Little Cat, “I was horrid
first, and I was just coming to say I was sorry.
Let’s never quarrel again, Little Dog; it is so
lonely!”</p>

<p>“Dear little things!” said Little Girl. “They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
are rubbing noses and telling each other something.
Oh, dear! and I was cross to Brother this
morning; I’m going to find him this minute and
say I am sorry and ask him to be my valentine.”</p>

<h2>MR. SPARROW’S BATH</h2>


<p>One day Johnny followed Mamma up into the
attic, where there are all kinds of pleasant things,
and he saw a very pleasant thing indeed. It was
a small dish, white with pink roses all over it;
really and truly, it was the prettiest dish that ever
was. Johnny said, “O-o-oh! may I have that dish
for mine?”</p>

<p>Mamma looked, and then she took the dish in
her hand and thought a minute. Mamma always
likes to be sure about things before she says
“Yes!” for fear it might not really be “yes”
after all. But now she nodded her head, and said,
“Yes, Johnny, you may have it.”</p>

<p>“O-oh!” said Johnny. “For my welly own?”</p>

<p>“For your very own. The rest of the set is
broken, and I have just kept this dish because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
is so pretty. Now you may take it down into
the nursery, and have it for a bath for Flora.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;">
<img src="images/ill38.jpg" width="409" height="620" alt="Johnny giving Flora a bath" />
<div class="caption">“NOW HE GAVE HER ONE IN THE ROSY-POSY DISH.”</div>
</div>

<p>Flora was a small doll, all china, and her clothes
came off, so she could have a bath any time, and
Johnny often gave her one. Now he gave her one
in the rosy-posy dish, and it was just exactly the
right size, and Johnny was so pleased, and said,
“Oh, thank you, <i>dear</i> Mamma!” without having
to be told. (Sometimes he forgets to say “thank
you,” but he is getting to be quite good about it.)</p>

<p>The next time Johnny went down-stairs, he took
the doll’s bath to show to Maggie, and she said
’twas the pick of the world for a dish, and asked
Johnny to lave her bake a cake in it; but Johnny
said no, not now, though perhaps by and by, for
now he must take it out to show to Muffy. Muffet
was out in the sand-box, and when Johnny showed
her the dish she mewed and rubbed against his
legs, and seemed to want something very much.</p>

<p>“Maggie,” said Johnny, “Muffy wants something!
What do you suppose it is?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure she might be wanting a sup o’ milk!”
said Maggie. “Bring me here the grand dish and
we’ll give the crature a sup in itself, and won’t
she be the proud kitty!” that is the way Maggie
talks; it is a nice, funny way, Johnny thinks.</p>

<p>Well! so Maggie filled the pretty dish with milk,
and Johnny set it down in the sand box before
Muffet, and she lapped it up, every single drop,
purring all the time. Johnny was watching her
when Mamma called him in to take his nap. Muffet
had not quite finished, so he left the dish standing,
and ran in to Mamma, and then he went for
his nap. When he woke up it was raining hard,
and it rained all the afternoon, so he did not go
out again, but stayed in the nursery building a
Choo Choo House. The next morning was bright
and clear, and the very first thing Johnny thought
of, when he had had his bath, and Mamma was
dressing him, was the rosy posy dish.</p>

<p>“I wants my diss,” said Johnny, “to give
Flora her bath!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>So Mamma looked for the dish, all over the
nursery, but it was not to be found.</p>

<p>“Where did you leave it, Johnny Boy?” said
Mamma. “Think a minute!”</p>

<p>So Johnny thought a minute, and then he remembered.
“I left it in the sand box,” he said.
“Muffy was very thirsty, and she was drinking
out of it, and you called me, and she hadn’t finished,
and so, you see—and so, you see—”</p>

<p>And Mamma said she saw. Then she looked out
of the window, and said yes, there was the dish,
right in the sand box, beside the red tin pail and
the blue tin pail and the old kitchen spoon. Then
she said, “Oh! oh, Johnny, come here and look!”</p>

<p>So Johnny went to the window, and stood on
his tippy-toe-toes, and looked; and what do you
think he saw? A little brown sparrow had come
fluttering down, and was drinking out of the rosy
posy dish. (You see, it had rained all night, so
the dish was full of water.) He perched on the
edge, and dipped his little beak in, and drank and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
drank; he must have been very thirsty. And then—oh!
oh! what did he do but hop down <i>into</i> the
dish, and begin taking his bath! He splashed, and
he shook himself, and rustled his feathers, and
then he splashed again. “Oh!” said Johnny.
“Oh! Mamma, he is doing it all himself. Nobody
told him to, not one bit.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
<img src="images/ill39.jpg" width="391" height="235" alt="bird bath in sandbox" />
</div>

<p>“No, indeed!” said Mamma. “He likes to
take his bath and be clean, just as Johnny does.
He knows it feels good to be clean.”</p>

<p>“Mamma!” said Johnny. “I want to tell you
something. Shall we have something else for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Flora, and let the rosy posy dish be the sparrow’s
bath, his ownty donty?”</p>

<p>“Suppose we do!” said Mamma. And they
did.</p>

<p>Mr. Peacock was proud. He had a fine long
train, a splendid crest, and the gayest blue-green
coat that ever was seen; and all day long he would
strut up and down the barnyard and say: “See
what a beauty I am!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;">
<img src="images/ill41.jpg" width="385" height="195" alt="Peacock" />
</div>

<p>The geese and ducks and turkeys were much
displeased at this. “Beauty, indeed!” they said.
“Of what use is your beauty? Can it hatch eggs?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Tell us that!” and they turned their backs and
walked away.</p>

<p>“These are stupid creatures!” said Mr. Peacock.
“Why should I stay among them? I will
go to the Fair, for there people will see my beauty
and admire it.”</p>

<p>So he spread his tail like a fan, raised his crested
head and strutted off down the road to the Fair.
Pretty soon he met some young men who also
were going to the Fair. “Aha!” said Mr. Peacock.
“These people will admire me!” and he
strutted more than ever.</p>

<p>“Look!” said the young men. “What a fine
peacock, and what splendid feathers he has! They
are just what we want for our hats.” They surrounded
Mr. Peacock, and, spite of his screams
of rage and terror, tore out three or four of his
finest tail feathers and went away laughing.
Presently he fell in with a large flock of geese
which a boy was driving to the Fair to sell. He
spread his tail and tried to push his way to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
head of the flock, but they took no notice of him
and waddled steadily on, keeping close together.</p>

<p>“Make way, you stupid creatures!” said Mr.
Peacock. “Keep your dirty feet off my fine
train!”</p>

<p>“Quack!” said an old gray goose, the grandmother
of the flock. “Keep your train out from
under our feet, Mr. Strut! Who asked you to join
our company?”</p>

<p>“Join your company, indeed!” cried Mr. Peacock.
“Get out of my way, you rude, clumsy
thing, and learn how to treat your betters!” and
he gave the goose a hard peck.</p>

<p>When the other geese, who loved their grandmother,
saw this, they all fell upon Mr. Peacock
and beat and pecked and hustled him till he
ran screaming away, dragging his tail behind
him.</p>

<p>He was now in a sad way, covered with dust,
and many of his finest feathers were torn and
broken; but still, when he came to the Fair he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
spread his tail, reared his crest and made as much
of himself as he could.</p>

<p>“I am still handsomer than any one else!” he
said, “and people will be sure to admire me.”</p>

<p>“Look there!” said a man. “There is a peacock.
Let us kill and stuff him and add him to our
show.” And he chased Mr. Peacock, who ran off
screaming with terror. Coming around a corner
he ran into a large dog who was coming the other
way.</p>

<p>“Get out of my way!” screamed Mr. Peacock.</p>

<p>“Get out of mine!” growled Mr. Dog, and he
grabbed Mr. Peacock by the neck, shook him hard
and tore out a great mouthful of feathers.</p>

<p>More dead than alive, the poor Peacock ran
and ran and ran, and never stopped till he got
home.</p>

<p>The geese and turkeys looked at him in great
surprise. “Who is this wretched, shabby bird?”
they asked each other. “It cannot possibly be
Mr. Peacock?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” sobbed the poor creature, “it is I; but
I have left my pride behind. If you will only let
me stay with you I will do my best to hatch eggs.”</p>

<p>But he never could.</p>

<h2>FAITHFUL TRUSTY<br />

<small>(Adapted)</small></h2>


<p>“Where are you going in such haste, friend?”
said Trusty, the shepherd’s Dog, to a great wolf
that was jogging along the same road.</p>

<p>“If I were sure you would not betray my secret,”
said the Wolf, with a sly leer, “I would let
you know.”</p>

<p>“You need not fear me; I shall tell no one a
word of the matter,” said Trusty.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the Wolf, “you must know,
as I was prowling around yonder cottage I saw
the farmer’s wife put a fine baby into the cradle,
and heard her say: ‘Lie still, my darling, and go
to sleep, while I run down to the village to buy
bread for your father’s supper.’ As soon as the
babe is asleep I shall go and fetch it: it is fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and fat, and will make a nice supper for me and
my cubs.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Trusty, “I would advise you to
wait a little longer, for I saw the baby’s mother
step into the next house to speak to a neighbor:
take care lest you are seen.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 387px;">
<img src="images/ill43.jpg" width="387" height="213" alt="Trusty sleeping next to cradle" />
</div>

<p>The Wolf thanked the Dog for his good advice,
for he did not know that the baby belonged to
Trusty’s master; and he said he would take heed
and keep close.</p>

<p>Then Trusty ran home with all the speed he
could. The door was ajar, and the innocent baby
was fast asleep in the cradle; so he lay down on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the mat behind the door and listened for the coming
of the Wolf. It was not long before he heard
the tread of the Wolf’s feet on the gravel path,
and in another minute the savage beast was in
the room and stealing with cautious steps to the
cradle; but just as he was preparing to seize the
poor baby Trusty sprang upon him and after a
fierce struggle laid him dead on the floor.</p>

<p>The first thing the mother saw on her return
was the Wolf dead at the foot of the cradle, while
the baby, unhurt, lay soundly sleeping on
his little pillow, and faithful Trusty watching
beside him. She flew to look the little one
all over, to make sure that he was safe and
sound, and then, oh! how she patted and fondled
the good Dog who had saved her darling’s life!
She called in all the neighbors, and told them what
Trusty had done, and from that time he became
the pet of the whole village, and all the mothers
wished they had such a dog to watch over their
children.</p>

<h2>THE GRATEFUL CRANE<br />

<small>(Adapted)</small></h2>


<p>Once a poor Crane was caught in a net, and
could not get out. She fluttered and flapped her
wings, but it was of no use, she was held fast.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, “what will become of me if
I cannot break this net? The hunter will come
and kill me, or else I shall die of hunger, and if
I die who will care for my poor little young ones
in the nest? They must perish also if I do not
come back to feed them.”</p>

<p>Now Trusty (the same Trusty who saved the
baby’s life) was in the next field and heard the
poor Crane’s cries. He jumped over the fence,
and seizing the net in his teeth quickly tore it in
pieces. “There!” he said. “Now fly back to
your young ones, ma’am, and good luck to you
all!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The Crane thanked him a thousand times. “I
wish all dogs were like you!” she said. “And I
wish I could do something to help you, as you have
helped me.”</p>

<p>“Who knows?” said Trusty. “Some day I
may need help in my
turn, and then you may
remember me. My old
mother used to say to me:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“To do a kind deed wherever we can,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Is good for bird and beast and man.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">
<img src="images/ill44.jpg" width="392" height="276" alt="crane caught in fish net, dog pulling on net" />
</div>

<p>Then Trusty went back to mind his master’s
sheep, and Mrs. Crane flew to her nest and fed and
tended her crane babies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Some time after this she was flying homeward
and stopped at a clear pool to drink. As she did
so she heard a sad, moaning sound, and looking
about, whom should she see but good Trusty, lying
on the ground, almost at the point of death. She
flew to him. “Oh, my good, kind friend,” she
cried, “what has happened to you?”</p>

<p>“A bone has stuck in my throat,” said the Dog,
“and I am choking to death.”</p>

<p>“Now, thank Heaven for my long bill!” said
Mrs. Crane. “Open your mouth, good friend, and
let me see what I can do.”</p>

<p>Trusty opened his mouth wide; the Crane
darted in her long, slender bill, and with a few
good tugs loosened the bone and finally got it out.</p>

<p>“Oh! you kind, friendly bird!” cried the Dog,
as he sprang to his feet and capered joyfully
about. “How shall I ever reward you for saving
my life?”</p>

<p>“Did you not save mine first?” said Mrs.
Crane. “Shake paws and claws, friend Trusty!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
I have only learned your mother’s lesson, which
you taught me, that</p>

<h2>THE KING OF THE FEN<br />

<small>(Adapted)</small></h2>


<p>“I will be King of the Fen!” said Croaker the
Frog, leaping out of the brook upon the dry land.</p>

<p>“You King, indeed!” said Slyboots, a fine, fat
Field Mouse with a long tail and bright eyes,
jumping out of his hole at the foot of a hazel bush
which grew near. “I am larger than you, and I
will be King, and the frogs shall be my subjects
and cut rushes and bring me dry moss to line my
nest.” And Slyboots strutted about and gave
himself a great many airs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;">
<img src="images/ill45.jpg" width="386" height="163" alt="Frog and the mouse" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>“I will never consent to be ruled by a Mouse,”
replied the Frog with a disdainful air. “How
finely King Slyboots would sound!”</p>

<p>“Quite as well as King Croaker!” retorted the
Mouse.</p>

<p>Then the Frog flew into a great passion and
hopped so high and croaked so loud that the Mouse
crept a little farther from him (for frogs, like children,
look very ugly when they are out of temper);
and Slyboots did not much like the idea of
being touched by his cold paws, and he said to himself:
“In spite of this Frog’s looking so fierce and
talking so loud I should not wonder if he were a
coward at heart.”</p>

<p>So he turned to the Frog and said: “As we
both wish to be King of the Fen I know of no way
of ending the dispute but by fighting, and the one
that wins the fight shall be King over the other.”</p>

<p>Then the Frog said: “Very well! We will each
bring a friend to see fair play. To-morrow at
twelve o’clock I shall be ready to take the field;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and if you fail to meet me here I shall be King of
the Fen, and the mice shall be my servants.” For
Croaker thought Slyboots was braver in word than
in deed, as cowards are often the foremost to talk
of fighting.</p>

<p>Then the Frog retired among the bulrushes and
the Mouse ran home to his hole under the nut tree.</p>

<p>The two rivals awoke next morning by break of
day to prepare for the combat, which was to take
place at noon. The Frog was very much afraid of
Slyboots’s sharp teeth and claws, so he fell to
work and made a shield from the bark of an old
willow tree, and then he plucked a long bulrush
for a spear. “Now,” said he, “I am well armed:
I have a shield to defend myself and a spear to attack
the enemy with. If I had but a brave friend
to be my second in the fight I should do very
well.”</p>

<p>“I will be your second,” said a great Pike, raising
his head above the water; “I will lie close to
the bank among these rushes, and if you break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
your spear come to me and I will procure you
another.”</p>

<p>The Frog was well pleased at this offer. “I
shall beat Slyboots in a little time,” said he, “with
such weapons and so good a friend.”</p>

<p>Slyboots in the meantime was not idle; he sharpened
his teeth and his claws and chose a light twig
from the hazel bush and said: “I only want now
a friend to be my second and see fair play.” A
great Hawk, which was hovering near, said: “Mr.
Slyboots, you may command my services at any
hour you please to name.”</p>

<p>Now Slyboots was somewhat afraid of the
Hawk, for he thought he had rather a hungry look
about the eyes and beak, but he dared not refuse
his offer lest he should give offence; so he thanked
him for his kindness, and at the appointed hour
they went to the spot where the Frog was waiting
for them. The Pike lay in the hole among the
rushes and the Hawk sat on the bough of a tree
close by.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 407px;">
<img src="images/ill46.jpg" width="407" height="613" alt="frog and mouse battling" />
<div class="caption">“THE BATTLE WAS LONG AND FIERCE ON BOTH SIDES.”</div>
</div>

<p>The Frog and the Mouse looked at one another
for a few minutes and shook their weapons. At
last the Hawk and the Pike gave signal for the
fight to begin. The battle was long and fierce on
both sides, and for some time it was doubtful
which would win. At last the Frog seemed to
gain ground, but at the very minute that he
seemed to be winning his spear broke in
pieces.</p>

<p>“Alas!” croaked he in a tone of dismay, “what
shall I do? Who will give me another
weapon?”</p>

<p>“Here is one,” cried his friend, the Pike, from
among the rushes.</p>

<p>The Frog gave a leap of joy and sprang toward
the Pike, who, opening his mouth, quickly put an
end to the battle by swallowing the hapless Frog
at one mouthful.</p>

<p>“I am King of the Fen now!” cried Slyboots
with a joyful squeak. “Long live your Majesty!”
exclaimed the crafty Hawk. As he spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
he darted from the tree and, pouncing upon the
new monarch, bore him away in his claws and put
an end to his reign and his life at the same
moment.</p>

<h2>THE TREES</h2>


<p>“Summer is gone!” said the Trees. “The fall
of the year is come, and it is time for us to dress
up and be gay.”</p>

<p>“I shall wear red!” said a Maple. “Sunset red
is my color.”</p>

<p>“Yellow for me!” said another. “My dress
shall be like pure gold.”</p>

<p>“I choose purple!” said the Ash. “It is the
color of Kings, and suits me very well.”</p>

<p>“What will you wear?” they all said to the
little Fir.</p>

<p>“I have no other dress!” said the Fir sadly.
“I must wear my plain green frock.”</p>

<p>“Te hee!” laughed the Maples and Birches and
Ash trees, rustling their leaves and nodding their
heads. “She has but one dress! What a poor
thing she is!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>But the old Pine waved his dark branches and
said: “Hush! hush! I know what I know!”</p>

<p>“We know, too,” cried the Maples. “We know
that in snow-time Santa Claus comes, and chooses
the finest tree, and dresses it in gold and silver
and hangs stars all over it. That is why we wish
to be fine and gay.”</p>

<p>“Hush! hush!” said the old Pine. “I know
what I know.”</p>

<p>So the trees put on their gay robes, gold and red
and purple, and each one was finer than the
rest; only the little Fir and the great old Pine
stayed just as they were, in their plain green
dresses.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 278px;">
<img src="images/ill48.jpg" width="278" height="361" alt="Christmas tree" />
</div>
<p>Now it grew cold, and a bleak wind blew
through the forest. The trees shivered and drew
their bright robes close around them. Colder
still it grew, and snow fell, and the wind moaned;
one day Jack Frost came in his silver coat
and touched the bright leaves with his shining
brush, and they curled up and turned brown, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
one by one, fell rustling to the ground. Soon the
poor Maples and Birches and the purple Ash who
thought he looked like a King stood all bare, and
the wind blew through their branches, and they
shook with the cold. They looked at the
Fir and wished that they had her warm,
green dress. Now came
Santa Claus, driving his reindeer
team through the
forest, cracking his whip
and jingling his bells. He looked at the trees with
his bright eyes.</p>



<p>“Ho! ho!” he said as he saw the Maples and
Birches. “What a beggarly set! Why, they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
not a cloak among them to keep them warm.
These will never do for me.”</p>

<p>But now he saw the little Fir, and a smile came
over his face.</p>

<p>“This is the tree for me!” he cried. “Will
you come with me, little Fir, and be the children’s
tree, and make many hearts glad?”</p>

<p>“That I will!” said the little Fir gladly.</p>

<p>So Santa Claus took her away and dressed her
in gold and silver and hung bright stars all over
her; and she became the Christmas Tree, and
many hearts were glad because of her.</p>

<p>“Hush! hush!” said the old Pine. “I knew
what I knew.”</p>

<h2>THE DEER AND THE CROW<br />

<small>(Adapted)</small></h2>


<p>Once upon a time in a deep wood lived a Deer
and a Crow, who were great friends and loved
each other dearly. One day, as the Deer was
roaming about alone, he met Small-Wit, the
Jackal.</p>

<p>Small-Wit was hungry, and when he saw the
fine fat Deer he said to himself: “Oho! if only
I could have this fat Deer for my supper!” So
he went up to the Deer, hanging his head and
looking very sad.</p>

<p>“Who are you, Friend?” asked the Deer, “and
why do you look so sad?”</p>

<p>“My name is Small-Wit,” said the Jackal;
“and I am sad because I have not a friend in the
world. Ah! if I could win your friendship how
happy I should be!”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the Deer, who was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
good-natured. “Come with me, and we will be
friends.”</p>

<p>He led the way to his home, and the Jackal followed
him. As they drew near, Sharp-Sense, the
Crow, called from the tree where he was perching:
“Who is this number two, Friend Deer?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
<img src="images/ill50.jpg" width="391" height="253" alt="Deer and crow" />
</div>

<p>“It is Small-Wit, the Jackal,” said the Deer.
“He is lonely, and wishes to be our friend.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Friendship with stranger,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Friendship with danger!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">said the Crow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nay!” said the Deer. “I like this rhyme
better:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Foe is friend, and friend is foe,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As our actions make them so.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Very good,” said Sharp-Sense: “as you
will.”</p>

<p>Next morning they went off hunting, and the
Jackal said to the Deer: “I know a field of sweet
corn, and I will take you there.”</p>

<p>So the Deer followed Small-Wit, and, sure
enough, they came to a field of sweet young
corn.</p>

<p>“You are a friend indeed!” cried the Deer,
and he feasted till suddenly he fell into a snare
which the farmer had laid.</p>

<p>“Alas!” cried the Deer, “Friend Small-Wit,
here am I caught by the feet, and cannot move.
Come, I pray you, and gnaw these cords with your
sharp teeth and set me free!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The Jackal came and looked at the snare.
“That will hold you fast enough,” he said. “To-day
is a fast day, but to-morrow I will have a
fine feast on your fat carcass, my foolish friend.”
And off he went.</p>

<p>Presently came along Sharp-Sense, the Crow,
who had been looking for his friend. “Alas!” he
cried, “how did this happen, Friend Deer?”</p>

<p>“Through not minding what you said,” replied
the Deer.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Crow, “we must do what we
can. Here comes the farmer. Do you lie still and
pretend to be dead until I croak: then spring up
and be off.”</p>

<p>The farmer came along and saw our friend lying
perfectly still. “Aha!” he cried, “this fellow
will eat no more of my corn.”</p>

<p>He stooped down and untied the cords of the
snare, meaning to carry off the dead Deer; but at
that moment the Crow gave a loud “Caw!” Up
sprang the Deer and in a moment was safe in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
forest. The farmer flung a club after him; it hit
Small-Wit, the Jackal, who was lurking near by
hoping to have a share of the spoil, and killed him;
and the two friends went home happy.</p>

<h2>LITTLE GOLDSTAR<br />

<small>(Adapted)</small></h2>


<p>In a southern garden lived a family of green
lizards, under the roots of a palm-tree. They were
merry little creatures, and their parents loved
them dearly.</p>

<p>One day Father Lizard said to his children:
“Your mother and I must go away this morning;
now be good children; stay close together, and
be sure that one of you keeps watch for fear of
snakes and hawks!”</p>

<p>The little lizards promised; and for some time
they were very careful; first one kept watch, and
then another; but at length Sprightly said:
“There is no danger near. Why should we not
all play together, just for a little while?”</p>

<p>Oh dear! they forgot their promise, and see
what came of it! While they were playing merrily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
a great snake glided quietly out from the
grass, seized poor Sprightly, and carried her off
to his den.</p>

<p>The other lizards fled in terror. Swiftfoot ran
up the tree, Longtail hid in the nest, and Goldstar
ran away and away, to the farthest end of the
garden. She did not dare to go home again, but
found a hole in the bank near a summerhouse,
and slipping into it, stayed all night, weeping for
the death of her dear Sprightly.</p>

<p>Next day she tried to find her way home, but
the garden was large, and she was too afraid of
snakes to go far; so she decided to stay where
she was, and make her home in the hole by the
summerhouse.</p>

<p>One day, as she was lying in the sun, Goldstar
saw a boy standing near her, with a cane in his
hand. At first she was afraid to move, fearing he
might strike her; but Carlos (for that was the
boy’s name) was fond of lizards, and would not
have hurt one for the world. He spoke softly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Goldstar, and she soon saw that he was kind and
good. He stroked her gently, first with a green
leaf, then with his hand, and Goldstar lay still,
and was not afraid any more.</p>

<p>They became great friends, and Carlos came
every day to see his pretty lizard and play with
her. One day, as he was coming down the garden
walk, he saw a large hawk hovering in the air
near the summerhouse, just about to dart down
on something. “Oh! my lizard! my lizard!”
cried Carlos; and he ran as fast as he could to
the spot, shouting and waving his arms. The
hawk flew screaming away, and Goldstar ran to
Carlos, and crept inside his jacket. She could
not speak, but he knew that she was glad, and
perhaps was trying to thank him in her own
way.</p>

<p>One very hot day, Carlos was taking a nap in
the summerhouse, when he was waked by something
running over his face. He brushed it away
without opening his eyes, but it came again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
still again. In fact, he could not get rid of it. At
last he sat up, wide awake and very angry, and
found that it was Goldstar. He tried to shake
her off, but she ran into his bosom. He was going
to pull her out in a pet, when, looking down, he
saw a large snake, with head raised and glittering
eyes, gliding slowly toward him. He knew its bite
was fatal, and he sprang up with a loud cry. The
snake stopped, and then turning, glided away
into the bushes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">
<img src="images/ill51.jpg" width="392" height="237" alt="boy asleep in summerhouse" />
</div>

<p>Very gently, Carlos drew his little pet from his
bosom, and stroked her green and golden back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
“Dear Goldstar,” he said, “if I saved you from
the hawk, you have saved me from the serpent. I
will love you and take care of you as long as you
live.” And so he did.</p>

<h2>THE CLEVER CROWS<br />

<small>(Adapted)</small></h2>


<p>A pair of crows had their nest in a certain tree.
It was a fine tree, and suited them well, but they
had a bad neighbor, a black snake, who often stole
and ate their young ones.</p>

<p>“Husband,” said Mrs. Crow, “we must leave
this pleasant home of ours; we shall never be able
to rear our children while that bad snake is
there.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” replied Mr. Crow, “think no more
about him. I have had enough of Black Snake,
and I am going to get rid of him.”</p>

<p>“What can you do against a huge snake like
that?” asked Mrs. Crow.</p>

<p>“Listen!” said Mr. Crow. “As you know, the
Prince comes every day to bathe in the fountain
under our tree. He has a fine gold chain, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
takes it off before he goes into the water, and lays
it on a stone. To-morrow, when he does this, do
you take the chain in your beak (for I shall be
away getting food for the babies), and drop it
into the hollow of the tree, taking care to give
some good loud ‘Caws’ while you do so. Then
wait and see what happens!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, next morning the young Prince
came as usual to bathe in the clear fountain. He
took off his gold chain and laid it on a stone, just
as Mr. Crow said he would; then he began to take
off his robes. Just then down flew Mrs. Crow,
took the chain in her yellow bill, and flew up into
the branches with it. “Oh! my chain! my
chain!” cried the Prince. “That crow has flown
away with it!”</p>

<p>“Have peace, your Highness!” replied his
servant. “The bird has not flown far; she
has this instant dropped the chain into a hole
in the tree, and I will climb up and get
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Up climbed the servant, and looked down into
the hole.</p>

<p>“Do you see my chain?” cried the Prince.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the servant, “I see it, shining in
the hole, but I see something else that is not so
pretty; the head of a great ugly black snake. If
your Highness will throw me up a stone, I will
kill the creature, for it is a poisonous snake.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">
<img src="images/ill53.jpg" width="392" height="317" alt="bird in tree" />
</div>

<p>So the Prince threw up a stone, and the servant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
caught it, and killed the snake with it. Then he
reached down into the hole, pulled out the gold
chain, and took it back to his master, who thanked
him kindly.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Mrs. Crow. “He is glad to get
back his fine jewel; but I am far happier, for I
have my babies safe and sound. See what it is
to have a clever husband! I must be sure to have
everything he likes best for supper to-night.”</p>

<p>So she did! I do not know what crows like best
for supper, so I cannot tell you; but they had a
wonderful feast, and the little ones picked the
bones, and there was no happier family in all the
forest than the Crow Family.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES</h2>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">
<img src="images/ill65.jpg" width="380" height="121" alt="birds flying" />
</div>

<p>There are many old, old stories about the dear
Christ Child when he was little. Not all of them
are true, but all are sweet and lovely; listen now,
and you shall hear one.</p>

<p>It had been raining in Nazareth, and the
ground, which had long been parched and dry, was
turned to wet clay. This was a wonderful thing
for the children, and they all ran to play with the
clay, just as you boys and girls do now. Some
dug canals and wells, some built houses and towers;
while others took the soft clay in their hands
and moulded it into shapes of men and animals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
The little Jesus joined this last group, and while
they made dogs and cats, horses and lions, he
made little gray doves, and set them one by one
on the edge of the fountain.</p>

<p>Presently sweet Mary the Mother came to the
door and looked out, to see what the children were
doing.</p>

<p>“See!” cried one little boy. “Mary Mother,
see my dog! he can almost wag his tail and bark.”</p>

<p>“Look at my lion!” cried another. “He is
so big and strong, he could eat up your dog in a
minute.”</p>

<p>“Ho!” said a third. “My man here could
whip your dog, and kill your lion with his sword,
so he is the best of all.”</p>

<p>Mary Mother smiled, and praised the dog, the
lion, and the man. Then she said, “And what
has my little Jesus to show me?”</p>

<p>“I have made some little gray doves,” said
Jesus. “See! here they are!”</p>

<p>“And what can they do, my little one?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
sweet Mary, as she stroked the boy’s curly
head.</p>

<p>“I think they can fly!” said little Jesus.
“Fly, pretty doves!”</p>

<p>He clapped his hands, and up flew the doves
like a soft gray cloud. Then fluttered round the
child’s fair head, and lighted for a moment on his
shoulders and his hands; then they spread their
gray wings and flew up into the sky, and were
seen no more.</p>

<h2>MERRY CHRISTMAS</h2>


<p>“What is going on to-day, Little Cat?” asked
Little Dog. “Every one seems so happy and
merry. I had chicken-bones for breakfast, with
ever so much meat on them!”</p>

<p>“I had creamed fish,” said Little Cat; “and
it was real cream. Look! Little Girl tied a red
ribbon round my neck, and said I was a beauty.
Am I, Little Dog?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for a cat!” said Little Dog. “Am I?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for a dog!” said Little Cat.</p>

<p>“I have a new collar, you see,” said Little Dog.
“And your girl has on a new blue dress, and my
boy a velvet jacket. And they are not going to
say one cross word all day; I heard them tell their
mother so.”</p>

<p>“I was in the nursery this morning,” said Little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Cat. “The children’s stockings were full of
toys and sugar-plums, and they kissed each other
and said, ‘Merry’—something! What can it all
mean?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 393px;">
<img src="images/ill66.jpg" width="393" height="304" alt="children with stockings hung on line, cat at feet" />
</div>

<p>“Let us ask Great Old Dog!” said Little Dog.
“He knows almost everything, and he can surely
tell us.”</p>

<p>Great Old Dog was asleep, but he woke up and
heard their story patiently. “It was ‘Merry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Christmas!’ that the children said,” he told
them. “This is Christmas Day.”</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” asked Little Cat.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand all about it,” said Great
Old Dog; “but it is the best day in the whole
year, for everybody is happy and kind, and tries
to do pleasant things for everybody else. I think
some one was born who brought kindness into the
world.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Little Dog; “if everybody is
going to be good we must be good, too. Little Cat,
I will not growl at you once to-day, even if they
put our dinner on the same plate!”</p>

<p>“Nor I at you,” said Little Cat, “even if there
is only one cushion by the fireside.”</p>

<p>“Nice Little Cat!” said Little Dog.</p>

<p>“Good Little Dog!” said Little Cat.</p>

<p>Just then in came Little Girl in her blue dress
and Little Boy in his velvet jacket. “Merry
Christmas!” they cried: “Little Cat and Little
Dog, and dear, good Great Old Dog!”</p>

<h2>CHRISTMAS GIFTS</h2>


<p>“Mother,” said Jack, “may I have some
money to buy Christmas presents with?”</p>

<p>“Dear,” said his mother, “I have no money.
We are very poor, and I can hardly buy food for
us all.”</p>

<p>Jack hung his head; if he had not been ten the
tears would have come to his eyes, but he was ten.</p>

<p>“All the other boys give presents!” he said.</p>

<p>“So shall you!” said his mother. “All presents
are not bought with money. The best boy
that ever lived was as poor as we are, and yet he
was always giving.”</p>

<p>“Who was he?” asked Jack; “and what did
he give?”</p>

<p>“This is his birthday,” said the mother. “He
was the good Jesus. He was born in a stable, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
he lived in a poor workingman’s house. He never
had a penny of his own, yet he gave twelve good
gifts every day. Would you like to try his way?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>So his mother told him this and that; and soon
after Jack started out, dressed in his best suit,
to give his presents.</p>

<p>First, he went to Aunt Jane’s house. She was
old and lame and she did not like boys.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” she asked as she opened
the door.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas!” said Jack. “May I stay
for an hour and help you?”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Aunt Jane. “Want to keep
you out of mischief, do they? Well! you may
bring in some wood.”</p>

<p>“Shall I split some kindling, too?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“If you know how!” said Aunt Jane. “I
can’t have you cutting your foot and messing my
clean shed all up.”</p>

<p>Jack found some fresh pine wood and a bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
hatchet, and he split up a great pile of kindling
and thought it fun. He stacked it neatly, and then
he brought in a pail of water and filled the kettle.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 213px;">
<img src="images/ill67.jpg" width="213" height="404" alt="boy with little axe" />
</div>

<p>“What else can I do?” he asked. “There are
twenty minutes more.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said
Aunt Jane. “You
might feed the pig.”</p>

<p>Jack fed the pig, who
thanked him in his own
way.</p>

<p>“Ten minutes
more!” he said.
“What shall I do
now?”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said
Aunt Jane. “You
may sit down and tell
me why you came.”</p>

<p>“It is a Christmas present!” said Jack. “I
am giving hours for presents. I had twelve, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
I gave one to Mother, and another one was gone
before I knew I had it. This hour was your present.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Aunt Jane. She hobbled to
the cupboard and took out a small round pie that
smelt very good. “Here!” she said. “This is
<i>your</i> present, and I thank you for mine. Come
again, will you?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will!” said Jack, “and thank you
for the pie!”</p>

<p>Next Jack went and read for an hour to old
Mr. Green, who was blind. He read a book about
the sea, and they both liked it very much, so the
hour went quickly. Then it was time to help
Mother get dinner, and then time to eat it; that
took two hours, and Aunt Jane’s pie was wonderful.
Then Jack took the Smith baby for a ride
in its carriage, as Mrs. Smith was ill, and they
met its grandfather, who filled Jack’s pockets with
candy and popcorn and invited him to a Christmas
Tree that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Next Jack went to see Willy Brown, who had
been ill for a long time and could not leave his
bed. Willy was very glad to see him; they
played a game, and then each told the other
a story, and before Jack knew it the clock struck
six.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Jack. “You have had two!”</p>

<p>“Two what?” asked Willy.</p>

<p>“Two hours!” said Jack; and he told Willy
about the presents he was giving. “I am glad
I gave you two,” he said, “and I would give you
three, but I must go and help Mother.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” said Willy. “I thank you very
much, Jack. I have had a perfectly great time,
and it has driven the pain away; but I have nothing
to give you.”</p>

<p>Jack laughed. “Why, don’t you see,” he cried,
“you have given me just the same thing? I have
had a great time, too.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” said Jack as he was going to bed,
“I have had a splendid Christmas, but I wish I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
had had something to give you besides the
hours.”</p>

<p>“My darling,” said his mother, “you have
given me the best gift of all, yourself!”</p>

<h2>PUSSY AND DOGGY</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 385px;">
<img src="images/ill73.jpg" width="385" height="217" alt="dog and cat outside door" />
</div>

<p>Pussy White and Doggy Brown were in the
yard one day. Doggy Brown thought he would
like to go into the house, so he went to the door,
but it was shut. He tried to open it by bumping
against it, but in vain. Then he barked, but no
one heard him. Then he felt very sad, and sat
down by the door and howled.</p>

<p>Pussy White had been watching him with one
eye, while she dozed with the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dogs are not very clever!” she said. Presently
she went to the door and jumped up and
lifted the latch with her paw. The door swung
open.</p>

<p>“There!” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, Pussy!” said Doggy Brown. “Thank
you; how clever you are!”</p>

<p>“That is one way of putting it,” said Pussy
White; “but you are welcome, all the same.”</p>

<h2>DICK’S FAMILY</h2>


<p>Now this is true, for we saw it with our eyes.
Dick was a bachelor, or so we had always supposed:
a large black bachelor, with bright green
eyes, and a very fine tail. He lived in the kitchen,
and managed things pretty much as he pleased.
When Peter, the new puppy, came he thought it
would be fun to tease Dick. Dick thought it would
be fun to be teased, and when he had sent Peter
yelping and ki-yi-ing out into the shed, he sat and
purred and blinked his green eyes, and thought
the world a pleasant place.</p>

<p>Now one day we looked out of the south parlor
window, and what do you think we saw? Dick
was coming across the lawn looking very proud
and very happy. Every now and then he stopped
and looked over his shoulder and mewed as if he
were calling some one to follow him. And some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
one was following him! Across the lawn after him
came:</p>

<p>One very thin and wretched-looking tortoise-shell
cat.</p>

<p>One Maltese kitten.</p>

<p>One yellow kitten.</p>

<p>All three looked half-starved, and all three were
scared out of their wits!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;">
<img src="images/ill74.jpg" width="406" height="196" alt="Cat with three kittens following" />
</div>

<p>“Come on!” said Dick, as plain as mew could
speak. “They won’t hurt you; those are my people:
they belong to me. Come on, I tell you!”</p>

<p>They came on, though still very timidly, till they
reached the barn. Then Dick took them under the
barn and there he made them comfortable, we do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
not know just how, because we cannot get under
the barn, and there they stayed. And when Dick
came for his supper he said to Maggie as plain as
mew could speak, “Please feed my family, too!”
and Maggie did.</p>

<p>That was a year ago. Now the tortoise-shell
cat is dead, but the Maltese kitten and the yellow
kitten are large and handsome cats, and Dick still
sits by the fire and purrs, and blinks his large
green eyes.</p>
